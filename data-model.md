# RoadrunnerPM Database Schema

## Core Data Model
The database schema reflects the domain's hierarchical structure.

### Primary Entities

#### Version
- Primary container for roadmap data
- Represents a complete snapshot of planning
- Properties:
  - Unique identifier
  - Version name/label
  - Creation timestamp
  - Status (active/archived)
  - Created by (user reference)

#### Category
- High-level organizational unit
- Examples: Product Lines, Solutions, Strategic Initiatives
- Properties:
  - Unique identifier
  - Name
  - Description
  - Display order
  - Version reference

#### Group
- Mid-level organizational unit
- Examples: Products, Capabilities, Feature Sets
- Properties:
  - Unique identifier
  - Name
  - Description
  - Display order
  - Category reference

#### Area
- Lower-level organizational unit
- Examples: Modules, Functions, Components
- Properties:
  - Unique identifier
  - Name
  - Description
  - Display order
  - Group reference

#### Item
- Fundamental planning unit
- Examples: Features, Epics, User Stories
- Properties:
  - Unique identifier
  - Name
  - Description
  - Start period
  - End period
  - Status
  - Priority
  - Area reference

## Relationships

### Hierarchical Structure
All relationships are implemented as one-to-many with foreign key constraints:

1. **Version → Categories**
   - One version contains multiple categories
   - Categories cannot exist without a version

2. **Category → Groups**
   - One category contains multiple groups
   - Groups cannot exist without a category

3. **Group → Areas**
   - One group contains multiple areas
   - Areas cannot exist without a group

4. **Area → Items**
   - One area contains multiple items
   - Items cannot exist without an area

### Timeline Implementation
Items are organized temporally through:

1. **Period Management**
   - Start and end periods stored as properties of items
   - Periods typically represent quarters
   - Custom period definitions supported

2. **Timeline Queries**
   - Efficient retrieval by time period
   - Support for overlapping periods
   - Period-based filtering and grouping

## Data Integrity

### Constraints
1. **Referential Integrity**
   - Foreign key constraints enforce hierarchical relationships
   - Cascading deletes maintain data consistency
   - Null constraints on required fields

2. **Business Rules**
   - Version uniqueness constraints
   - Display order management
   - Period validity checks

### Validation
1. **Required Fields**
   - Names required at all levels
   - Period assignment required for items
   - Version status validation

2. **Data Quality**
   - Unique naming within siblings
   - Valid period ranges
   - Status transitions

## Query Optimization

1. **Hierarchical Queries**
   - Indexed foreign keys
   - Optimized tree traversal
   - Efficient nested loading

2. **Timeline Queries**
   - Indexed period fields
   - Optimized range queries
   - Efficient filtering and sorting

3. **Common Access Patterns**
   - Version comparison queries
   - Timeline aggregation
   - Hierarchical navigation
